<h1>Hangman in C++</h1>
<p>I will be making a hangman application with ASCII art, I do not have any code right now.</p>
<p>What I will be adding to the project will be an array of words that will be chosen at random and will be showing the blank letters to the user and they have to type one letter.
  If they get it right, one or more blanks will be revealed with that letter and nothing will happen to the hangman. If they get it wrong, one by one the limbs get lost until
the user loses.</p>
